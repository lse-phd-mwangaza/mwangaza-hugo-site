## Some background

According to recent figures, Black PhD applicants have the lowest success rate when applying for a doctoral program and are also less likely to choose to do one.1. Consequently, Black students are often the smallest demographic of PhD candidates across the UK.  

Mwangaza was formed by a group of like-minded Black PhD students across different departments at LSE to foster the increase of the representation and contribution of minority groups within academia, 
diversifying the image of knowledge producers across all disciplines.
